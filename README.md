# Interactive_Learning

This project enables learners to upload an image and:

- Generate a depth map using MiDaS (DPT_Large) via Torch Hub.
- Create a 3D mesh (GLB) and a point cloud (PLY) from the image and depth.
- Obtain an educational summary and chat context about the image.
- Export a learning report (summary + chat) as a PDF.

## Features

#### 2D → 3D conversion:
- Depth estimation (MiDaS) with GPU/CPU auto-detection.
- Mesh export as GLB and point cloud export as PLY.
- Depth map saved as PNG.
#### AI-assisted learning:
- Image summary generation (optional integration).
- Chat endpoint for Q&A on the image (optional integration).
#### Reporting:
- Export session data as a PDF (optional integration).
- Static serving of generated assets via FastAPI.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React/Next.js frontend uses the App Router pattern with TypeScript, integrating Three.js and React Three Fiber for 3D visualization. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components, providing an interactive learning experience.
- React.js with Next.js App Router
- Three.js and React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Radix UI components

### Backend

- FastAPI backend handles depth estimation using MiDaS (DPT_Large) via PyTorch Hub, with automatic GPU/CPU detection. The system generates three key outputs: depth maps (PNG), 3D meshes (GLB via Trimesh), and point clouds (PLY). The backend also includes AI-assisted learning features with image summary generation and chat endpoints for Q&A interactions
- Python with FastAPI
- PyTorch for ML models
- MiDaS for depth estimation
- OpenCV for image processing
- Trimesh for 3D mesh generation
- PyRender for 3D rendering

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.7 with pip
- Node.js V24.11.1 with npm 11.6
- (Optional) CUDA-capable GPU for faster depth estimation.
- Internet access for first run (Torch Hub downloads MiDaS weights).
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Basava14/Interactive_Learning.git
   cd interactive_learning
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r req_full.txt
   ```
4. **Install Python dependencies**
    install additional liberies like Torch, timm

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`


### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd 2d-to-3d-converter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
